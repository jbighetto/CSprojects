Final project 591 L1 - Julia Bighetto and Kyle Bryant

HOW TO RUN THE CODE:
- The main file is called final_project.py.
- final_project.py reads artist_list.py, alg.py, and scrapereddit.py.
- alg.py reads dic.py.

For the simplicity of the project, the majority of the data is hard-coded. Just make sure to have the three main files at 
the same directory to fully run the project.
