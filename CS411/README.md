## Project Goals
Goals of this project include creating a web-based application to support students who are looking for flights or places to go over Spring, Winter, or Summer breaks.

## Project Overview
The user logs in using his or her gmail account, then inputs his or her list of countries he or she is interested in traveling to. This gets cached to our database, and the next page is a list of flights to important airports within the country, along with the price in USD or its respective currency.

## Dependencies
To solve dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## To Run
To run: `./run.sh`
