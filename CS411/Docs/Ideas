Idea 1: The perfect travel destination
  For this idea, we chose to create a website that will help you choose your next travel destination. 
 The user will create a profile with budget, weather of preference, location (continent/country) and time. 
 We then will use APIs such as the weather, currency, and flights to compare and contrast different places to find the destination with the desired weather within your budget.

Idea 2: Finding events near you
  For this idea, we decided to use Google Calendar and another API that will give us a list of events happening near our user. 
The objective is for the user to receive notifications of events that they might be interested in and that fits their schedule. 
So for example, if the user inputs that they are interested in food events, they live in Boston, and they have a free block on Friday from 5-10pm, if there's a food truck event at North End at that same time we would send a notification to the user about that event.
